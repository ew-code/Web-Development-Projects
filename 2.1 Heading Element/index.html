    <!-- It's not good practice to have more than one H1 because the H1 is the very top level heading. -->
    <!-- Don't have more than one H1. -->
    <!-- Instead, if you need another subtitle or another level of heading, then go to the H2 or H3 or all -->

    <!-- Don't skip a level. -->
    <!-- When you're creating heading elements, don't go straight from H1 to H3. -->
    <!-- If you have an H3, there should also be an H2 somewhere on that web page. -->
    <!-- Instead, I recommend to just go in order when you have an H1 that you've created and then you realize -->
    <!-- And then if you need another level of heading that's even lower in priority, go to an H3. -->
    <!-- Don't jump between the different level headings. -->
